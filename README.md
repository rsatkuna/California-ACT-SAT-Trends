### Overview

Our first module in DSI covers:
- Basic statistics and probability
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- EDA
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

You might wonder if you're ready to start doing data science. While you still have **tons** to learn, there are many aspects of the data science process that you're ready to tackle. Project 1 aims to allow you to practice and demonstrate these skills.

For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to address our problem statement.

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Problem Statement

Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. This problem is ultimately up to you, but below are some guidelines/things to consider when crafting a problem statement:
> 1. Consider your audience. Who is your project going to help? Who will your presentation be geared towards? Establishing your audience first can help you narrow down your scope.
> 2. Consider the data you will use. Based on the contents of this data, think about some questions you could reasonably answer. These questions should aim to solve some kind of problem.
> 3. Based on these questions, what would bring some kind value to your audience? This can be business insights, increase sales, make decisions, etc.
> 4. Put everything from the above steps together into a few sentences that describe the specific problem you are trying to solve and who it will benefit.
> [Here is a blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/defining-a-data-science-problem-4cbf15a2a461) about crafting a data science problem statement.

Here are some example prompts if you need inspiration:
> * The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward non-technical executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a *state of your choice*.
> * You work for a school district that has asked you to advise their high school students on what SAT or ACT score they should be aiming for based on their intended area of study or school preferences.
> * You are hired by the state of California to analyze standardized test performance for various districts in the state and identify trends so they can allocate resources appropriately.
> * Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html)). You are hired by a college to advise their admissions team on why this should or should not continue beyond the Fall 2021 applications. (Note: problem statements related to this prompt may not be reasonable to answer just using the data provided. If you want to tackle this one, you may need to find additional data online.)
> * *Feel free to be creative with your own prompt!*

And here are some example problem statements related to the above prompts. Come up with your own or modify these for your needs, do not just copy the ones given here:
> * The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. Since then, levels of participation in multiple states have changed with varying legislative decisions. This project aims to explore trends in SAT and ACT participation for the years 2017-2019 and seeks to identify states that have decreasing SAT participation rates.
> * High school students often know which colleges they would like to consider, but rarely know what SAT or ACT score they should aim for when applying to these colleges. We wish to explore the schools that have the highest and lowest SAT and ACT score requirements and see if there is a relationship between college prestige and test scores.
> * The state of California has many school districts. This project aims to identify the districts that have the worst overall student performance on the SAT and ACT tests so the state can recommend programs and allocate resources to these districts in need. 
> * We hypothesize that student performance on these tests is not an indicator of overall academic performance. This project seeks to see if a relationship exists between student GPA and SAT/ACT scores to support or oppose the continuation of these tests as a requirement for college applications.
> * *Feel free to be creative with your own problem statement!*

### Deliverables

All of your projects will comprise of a written technical report and a presentation. As we continue in the course, your technical report will grow in complexity, but for this initial project it will comprise:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- Your presentation slideshow rendered as a .pdf file.
**NOTE**: Your entire Github repository will be evaluated as your technical report. Make sure that your files and directories are named appropriately, that all necessary files are included, and that no unnecessary or incomplete files are included.

For your first presentation, you'll be presenting to a **non-technical** audience. You should prepare a slideshow with appropriately scaled visuals to complement a compelling narrative. **Presentation duration will differ by market, so check with your local instructor.**

---

### Technical Report Starter Code

Future projects will require you to decide on the entire structure of your technical report. Here, we provide you with [starter code](./code/starter-code.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook that will help to guide your data exploration and analysis. **If you choose to edit the core structure of this notebook, make sure you don't exclude any of the requested operations**.

### Style Guide and Suggested Resources

[Tim Dwyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtimdwyer/) (former DSI student and TA) put together [this style guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-13/style_guide). Some recommendations are geared toward future projects (which will include modeling and span multiple notebooks), but generally these are great recommendations.

Here's a link on [how to give a good lightning talk](https://www.semrush.com/blog/16-ways-to-prepare-for-a-lightning-talk/), which provides some good recommendations for short presentations.

[Here's a great summary](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407) of the main points of the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I can't recommend enough. [Here's a blog post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/8/9/my-guiding-principles) by the author about his guiding principles for visualizations.

### Submission

Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:

- A README.md (that isn't this file)
- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis (renamed to describe your project)
- Data files
- Presentation slides
- Any other necessary files (images, etc.)

**Check with your local instructor for how they would like you to submit your repo for review.**

---

### Presentation Structure

- **Must be within time limit established by local instructor.**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience (executives with the College Board, school administrators, admissions counselors, State officials, etc.).
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
